<h2>Change log</h2>
<h2>1.2.1</h2>

<h3>Fixes and changes:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue where playlists would appear empty when switching between playlists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.2.0</h2>

<h3>Fixes and changes:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Centred some elements in the player controls.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where playing next track would fail when the last track in the library was playing.</li>
  <li>Fixed the loading bar not showing during some procedures when it really should have been.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with the window content extending below the player controls.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue with the checkboxes missing in the playlist manager.</li>
  <li>The library file is now read less frequently during normal operation. This significantly reduces disk usage and speeds up some operations, such as loading a playlist.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the first track in a playlist could not be played if nothing else had been played before.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the loading bar would be stuck on when the previous track was attempted to be played when it was the last item in the play history.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New features:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Library import and export:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>You can now export your music and playlists to a .sfd file.</li>
    <li>You can now import music and playlists from a .sfd file.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>You can now manually import a local audio file to StreamFusion. For the time being you can only import mp3 files.</li>
  <li>Media keys now work when the StreamFusion window is focused. Global OS-wide support may be coming at some point, but right now the best solution would be to basically have a keylogger constantly running in the background, and I don't know about you but that seems like a slight security issue. Supported keys are:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Play/pause</li>
    <li>Next</li>
    <li>Previous</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
